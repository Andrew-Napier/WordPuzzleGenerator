# WordPuzzleGenerator

Messy mac-osx command line project to generate word puzzles.  
Still lots to do.

1. Remove fixed word list in preference to using a "source" for the words.
2. Attempt weighting of "best-possible-fit" based off number of words with the same orientation. (i.e. distribute them more evenly)
3. Determine distribution of word-lengths to make a more ideal puzzle.
4. Shuffle the blatted word before inserting it into the grid.
5. Refactor / add-tests.
6. Create output format.
